SAD-2.4: Manual Note Entry & Context Injection

1. Purpose:  
   To introduce a feature allowing the therapist to manually add private, unspoken notes to the session log. These notes will be treated as first-class contextual information and made available to the AI to enrich its analysis and suggestions.

2. User Interface (UI) Changes (`page.tsx`):  
   - Add a multi-line `<textarea>` near the "Staging Area" or "Final Transcript Log".  
   - Add an "Add Note" button, disabled until the textarea contains text.

3. Client-Side Logic (`page.tsx`):  
   **New State Variable:**  
       const [noteText, setNoteText] = useState("");  
   
   **New Handler Function: `handleAddNote()`**  
       function handleAddNote() {  
           if (!noteText.trim()) return;  
           const newNoteEntry = { speaker: 'note', text: noteText.trim() };  
           setTranscriptLog(prevLog => [...prevLog, newNoteEntry]);  
           setNoteText("");  
       }  

4. “Simulated Reality” & Payload Changes:  
   - **`createActionMessages(buffer)`** must skip entries where `speaker === 'note'`.  
   - **`formatHistoryToString(messages)`** (server-side) must render note entries clearly:  
         [Therapist’s Private Note]: Client seemed hesitant discussing their family.

5. Prompting Strategy & Context Injection:  
   - **Low-Context Actions:**  
       1. Build `messagesForAction` (notes filtered out).  
       2. Build `notesString` from buffer notes only.  
       3. Inject into system prompt:  
           
           You are a caring therapist…  
           
           ### THERAPIST’S PRIVATE NOTES (for context) ###  
           ${notesString}  
           
           <Rest of instructions>  
   - **High-Context Actions:**  
       Notes already appear in the formatted history via `formatHistoryToString`, so the existing “Instruction Sandwich” prompt works unchanged.

6. Implementation Plan:  
   - Add the `<textarea>` and “Add Note” button in `page.tsx`.  
   - Implement `noteText` state and `handleAddNote`.  
   - Update `TranscriptEntry` type to include `'note'`.  
   - Modify `createActionMessages` to filter out notes.  
   - Modify server logic in `route.ts` to inject notes into low-context prompts.  
   - Modify `formatHistoryToString` to render notes for high-context prompts.

This feature captures the therapist’s internal clinical reasoning, giving the AI richer, “unspoken” context to draw from.
